Backing the entrepreneurs of financial advice</h1></i></b></p>



<p>We’re strong believers in the power of financial advice. We’ve spent more than 20 years championing financial advisers and the positive role they play in helping people manage their money. 

We’re also a business with entrepreneurship at its heart. We’re still founder-led and we’ve backed many of the UK’s most successful businesses, from Octopus Energy to Zoopla. 

Now, we’re combining these two powerful ideas. 

We often hear advisers worry about how to scale their business whilst retaining the magic their clients love. The bigger a firm gets, the less time founders and advisers have to spend with their clients. Running the business becomes the job. As advisers spend more time running a business there’s a natural ceiling to the number of clients they can look after. There are wider challenges too, including building the technology and operational capability that enables a firm to scale. And there’s the capital needed to make these things possible. </p>
